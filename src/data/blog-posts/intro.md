In the 1950s, Alan Turing had posed his famous question “Can Machines Think ?”. Back then, he considered the question to be vague \& ambiguous and instead proposed the Turing Test as a way to measure the intelligence of machines. It had human evaluators judge conversation transcripts between a machine and a human and identify which was the machine. Seven decades later, we are closer than ever to hitting this benchmark with the latest large language models (LLMs) like GPT o4, Deepseek R1 easily passing the Turing Test. They are capable of complex thought \& reasoning, fluent dialogue, and even image generation. AI/ML models have been theorized for and even implemented such as the M.P neuron or the Perceptron for over half a century. From these theoretical concepts, it has evolved massively with the potential to be embedded in all aspects of modern life, particularly in many critical domains such as healthcare. While the capabilities are real, so is the hype with many arguing that we are currently in an AI bubble with companies adding AI features that weren’t even asked for such as smart AI enabled toothbrushes or another AI startup whose entire business model is just a wrapper around ChatGPT.
