In the 1950s, Alan Turing had posed his famous question “Can Machines Think ?”. Back then, he considered the question to be vague \& ambiguous and instead proposed the Turing Test as a way to measure the intelligence of machines. It had human evaluators judge conversation transcripts between a machine and a human and identify which was the machine. Seven decades later, we are closer than ever to hitting this benchmark with the latest large language models (LLMs) like GPT o4, Deepseek R1 easily passing the Turing Test. They are capable of complex thought \& reasoning, fluent dialogue, and even image generation. AI/ML models have been theorized for and even implemented such as the M.P. neuron or the Perceptron for over half a century. From these theoretical concepts, it has evolved massively with the potential to be embedded in all aspects of modern life. While its capabilities are real and growing, so is the hype surrounding it with many arguing that we are currently in an AI bubble where companies are adding AI features that weren’t even asked for such as smart AI enabled toothbrushes or another AI startup whose entire business model is just a wrapper around ChatGPT. But while gimmicky AI products dominate headlines, the healthcare sector shows where AI might actually be revolutionary, benefitting significantly from recent advancements in AI. [^1]

Currently, healthcare systems around the world are in unprecedented strain. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates a shortage of 10 million health workers by 2030, with it disproportionately affecting low and middle income countries. Even in developed and advanced countries like the UK, the NHS faces a backlog of millions of patients awaiting treatment. Increased lifespans and tapering population pyramids have led to increased demand for healthcare services which many systems are failing to meet. These issues are only made worse by other problems like staff burnout, lack of specialists, delays in testing, etc. The consequences of these pressures are severe, with delayed diagnosis leading to easily avoidable complications, increased treatment costs and even death. The current healthcare model, while still effective, is clearly showing its limitations and inability to keep up with growing demand in the future decades.

AI and ML techniques can offer a viable and much needed augmentation to the entire domain. Advancements in computer vision and deep learning have created previously unimaginable diagnostic capabilities. Studies have shown that AI based systems utilizing computer vision can match or even outperform expert radiologists in tasks like detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays or even identifying early signs of cardiovascular disease. DeepMind by Google developed an AI model that outperformed human specialists in breast cancer detection from mammograms. There are already startups like Viz.ai and Aidoc, that help hospitals integrate AI image analysis tools into their workflow. Furthermore, AI systems can also analyze patient records and real-time health data to create personal treatment plans unique to each patient. It has the potential to dramatically expand access to healthcare in lower resource regions of the world, supporting healthcare workers by automating triage and reducing burden on the already overworked staff.

AI chatbots and virtual assistants have already been deployed by the NHS (North West London NHS Trust) during the Covid-19 global pandemic which is a real example of AI expanding access to healthcare and reducing the burden on healthcare staff. The chatbots were available 24/7, offer basic advice regarding symptoms, triage non-emergency queries and even followed up previous messages like a human conversation. This automation helped reduce the burden on clinical staff and freed up doctors to focus on more complex cases. Early preventative care is another area where AI shows significant potential. ML models can identify patients at risk well in advance of traditional screening methods by analysing data such as lifestyle choices, genetic data and health records. By having earlier interventions, such systems can reduce hospital visits which lowers healthcare costs and can save lives. The integration of AI with wearable health devices like fitness trackers, is further reshaping the healthcare landscape. They allow patients to monitor various vital health metrics themselves without needing to visit clinics.

However, the integration of AI into healthcare comes with its own issues regarding bias,  ethical concerns, lack of transparency, and questions of accountability. Thus, it is essential that fairness, trust and safety are prioritized considering healthcare is a field where accuracy and speed could be the difference between recovery and death.
